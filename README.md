## Description

Most people go abroad for a trip or some other purpose; it is difficult to search for places or local things away from your home country. This project proposes using web technology to build an online portal for people to ask for recommendations and reviews regarding various things such as restaurants, parks, movies, books, and many more things. This project targets not only international destinations but also for local people who want to explore new things. ReCom is a straightforward and lightweight portal; it functions to post a question and get recommendations and reviews. ReCom will use the count of ratings and reviews to generate a result on a scale of 100, which will keep on changing depending upon upcoming reviews from people. The website would serve those users who have to scroll through pages of results to find appropriate content. This project will focus on user ratings and reviews to help the user get a good review.
